The Nautilus DevOps team is embracing serverless architecture by integrating AWS Lambda into their operational tasks. They have decided to deploy a simple Lambda function that will return a custom greeting to demonstrate serverless capabilities effectively. This function is crucial for showcasing rapid deployment and easy scalability features of AWS Lambda to the team.
