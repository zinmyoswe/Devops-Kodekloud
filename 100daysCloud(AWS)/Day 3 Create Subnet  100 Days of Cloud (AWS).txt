The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition.

For this task, create one subnet named xfusion-subnet under default VPC.

Solution:

check created subnet under existing vpc. and then calculate the new subnet IPv4 subnet CIDR block.
172.31.32.0/20 => 3rd
172.31.0.0/20 => 1st
172.31.80.0/20 => last created
172.31.16.0/20 => 2nd

172.31.96.0/20 => plus last created 80+16 =96

VPC > Subnets > Create subnet ->add 172.31.96.0/20 in IPv4 subnet CIDR
