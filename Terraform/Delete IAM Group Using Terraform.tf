The Nautilus DevOps team is currently engaged in a cleanup process, focusing on removing unnecessary data and services from their AWS account. As part of the migration process, several resources were created for one-time use only, necessitating a cleanup effort to optimize their AWS environment.

Delete an IAM group named iamgroup_james using terraform. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solution:

main.tf
resource "aws_iam_group" "this" {
  name = "iamgroup_james"
}

terraform init
terraform destroy -target=aws_iam_group.this
