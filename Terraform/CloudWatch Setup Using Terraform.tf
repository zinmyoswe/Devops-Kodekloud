The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up CloudWatch logging for their application. They need to create a CloudWatch log group and log stream with the following specifications:

1) The log group name should be devops-log-group.

2) The log stream name should be devops-log-stream.

Use Terraform to create the CloudWatch log group and log stream. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.
