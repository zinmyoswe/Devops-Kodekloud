Day 44 Write a Docker Compose File
The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:



a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).


b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.


c. Map 80 number port of container with port 5002 of docker host.


d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/data volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

Solution:

ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su -

cd /opt/docker

vi docker-compose.yml

version: "3.8"

services:
  web:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "5002:80"
    volumes:
      - /opt/data:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs

#run docker Compose
docker compose up -d

docker ps

curl http://localhost:5002
