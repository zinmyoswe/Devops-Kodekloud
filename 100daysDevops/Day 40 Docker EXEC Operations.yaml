Day 40 Docker EXEC Operations
One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:


a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.


b. Configure Apache to listen on port 6400 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc.


c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end.

Solution:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo su -

#check container running
docker ps

#enter to container with exec
docker exec -it kkloud bash

#install Apache
apt update
apt install -y apache2

cat /etc/apache2/ports.conf
#edit apache port to default 80 to 6400
sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 6400/' /etc/apache2/ports.conf

cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
#edit default site config
sed -i 's/<VirtualHost \*:80>/<VirtualHost *:6400>/' /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf


service apache2 restart
service apache2 status

exit

docker ps
docker ps | grep kkloud
