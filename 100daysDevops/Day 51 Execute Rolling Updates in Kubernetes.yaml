Day 51 Execute Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.19 with the latest updates.


Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.19 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.

Ensure all pods are operational post-update.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster

Solution:

#check deployment
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment

#check current images and container
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment

#rolling update of image old to new
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.19

kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml | grep -i container

#check rolling update status
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

#check pods is running
kubectl get pods

kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment | grep Image
