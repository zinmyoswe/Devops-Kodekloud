Day 37 Copy File to Docker Container
The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named ubuntu_latest is running on the same server.



Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from the docker host to the ubuntu_latest container located at /tmp/. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

Solution:

ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su -

#check container is running or not
docker ps

docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/tmp/

#check reach file to Container
docker exec ubuntu_latest ls -lah /tmp/
