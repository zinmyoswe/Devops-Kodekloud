The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/news.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:



One of the developers is working on feature branch and their work is still in progress, however there are some changes which have been pushed into the master branch, the developer now wants to rebase the feature branch with the master branch without loosing any data from the feature branch, also they dont want to add any merge commit by simply merging the master branch into the feature branch. Accomplish this task as per requirements mentioned.


Also remember to push your changes once done.

Solution:

ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su -

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
cd news
git status

git branch

git remote -v

#fetch the change in master
git fetch origin master

#-a mean all
git fetch -a

git log --oneline

#type of divide from origin
git rebase origin/master

git log --oneline

git push
git push -u origin feature -f
