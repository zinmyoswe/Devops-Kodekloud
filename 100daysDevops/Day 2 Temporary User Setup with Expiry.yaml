Day 2: Temporary User Setup with Expiry

As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named mariyam requires access for a limited duration.
 To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:

Create a user named mariyam on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2023-12-07, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.


Solution:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo su -
sudo useradd -e 2023-12-07 mariyam

Validation:
grep mariyam /etc/passwd
